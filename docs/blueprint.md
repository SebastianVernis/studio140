## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(225, 70%, 50%) which translates to #3D5AFE. This evokes trust and innovation, without feeling clich√©.
- Background color: HSL(220, 20%, 96%) which translates to #F2F4FF. It maintains a visual link to the primary color.
- Accent color: HSL(195, 70%, 40%) which translates to #3498DB. This contrast subtly and creates visual interest, complementing the indigo-influenced primary.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look, with a slightly technical, neutral feel
- Use simple, clear icons from a consistent set. Filled or dual-tone icons are acceptable, and should be in the accent color, to indicate their interactive status
- Use a card-based layout for displaying generated content, with a clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle loading animations to indicate content generation is in progress.
